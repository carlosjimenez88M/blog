# Some approach
## Bootstrapping techniques

* First : Bootstrap is a powerful method for statistical inference (with based on computational algorithms) that allows assigning measures of accuracy to sample estimates.

* Second : It`s widely applied in other statistical inference such as 
    + Confidence interval
    + Regression Models
    + Machine Learning
    
Some conceptions : i) Assume the data is representative, ii) use random sample with replacement to make inferences about the unknown population (statistical universe). iii) Calculate or compute robust statistics tools - mean, variance , error , median , etc through on samples. iv) repeat steps many times to creat bootstrap distribution


In this example , with iris , I generate bootstrap distribution for median. 



```{r}
sepal_med_ci<-iris%>%
  specify(response = Sepal.Length )%>% # Specify the variable of interes
  generate(reps = 100, type="bootstrap")%>%
  calculate(stat = "median")

sepal_med_ci%>%
  head()%>%
  knitr::kable(format = 'markdown', caption = 'Bootstrap Distribution for media')
```




Now , is necessary generate histogram plot about this

```{r}
sepal_med_ci%>%
  ggplot(aes(stat))+
  geom_histogram(bins = 10)+
  labs(title = 'Boostrap Distribution')+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```


## Percentile and Standard Error Methods


Is necessary computing intervals for median `Sepal.length`  using [percentile method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile)


But first this step

```{r}
sepal_med_obs<-iris%>%
  summarize(Sepal_med = median(Sepal.Length))%>%
  pull() # pull out value
```

Computing freedom degrees

```{r}
degrees_of_freedom <- nrow(iris) - 1
```


Determinig the critical values 

```{r}
t_star <- qt(0.975, df=degrees_of_freedom)
print(t_star)
```

Calculate the Confidence interval using std error method

```{r}
sepal_med_ci%>%
  summarize(boot_se=sd(stat))%>%
  summarize(
    u = sepal_med_obs - t_star * boot_se,
    l = sepal_med_obs + t_star * boot_se
  )
```

And recall the interval confindence the percentile method

```{r}
sepal_med_ci %>%
  summarize(
    l = quantile(stat, 0.025),
    u = quantile(stat, 0.975)
  )
```

The standard error method is a better estimate.

```{r}
visualize(sepal_med_ci,bins = 10)+
  shade_confidence_interval(endpoints =c(5.564156,6.035844))
```


## Re-centering a bootstrap distribution


Boostrap distribution are by design centered at  the observed sample  statistics. However since in a Hypothesis test we assume that the null hypothesis is true, we shift the bootstrap distribution to be centered at the null value.

The p-value is then defined as proportion of simulations that yield a sample statistic at least as favorable to the alternative hypothesis as observed sample statistics.

```{r}
n_replicates<-300

sepal_med_ht <- iris %>%
  specify(response = Sepal.Length) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "point", med = 5.8) %>% 
  generate(reps = n_replicates, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "median")

sepal_med_ht%>%
  head()%>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Generate 15000 bootstrap samples centered at null.")
  
```


Now Calculate the observed median Sepal


```{r}
sepal_med_obs <- iris %>%
  summarize(median_sepal = median(Sepal.Length)) %>%
  pull()

print(sepal_med_obs)
  
```



Now Calculate the p-value as the proportion of bootstrap statistics greater than the observed statistic.


```{r}
sepal_med_ht %>%
  # Filter for bootstrap stat greater than or equal to observed stat
  filter(stat >= sepal_med_obs) %>%
  # Calculate the p-value
  summarize(p_val = n() / n_replicates)
```

Now one question : We would like to evaluate whether this data provides evidence that the median Sepal of Iris Sepal Length   is greater than 5.8 cm. **What is the conclusion of the hypothesis test at the 5% significance level?**

We dont have evidence that median Sepal Length  in Iris is grater that 5.8. We fail to reject H0 since the p-value is above the significance level



## Other example


We'll wrap up inference on a single parameter of a numerical distribution by revisiting the ncbirths dataset, specifically the weight variable, indicating the birth weight of the baby. Do these data provide convincing evidence that the average birth weight of babies born in North Carolina is different than 7 pounds?

```{r}
data(ncbirths)

n_replicates <- 1500

weight_mean_ht <- ncbirths %>%
  specify(response = weight) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "point", mu = 7) %>% 
  generate(reps = n_replicates, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean")


weight_mean_ht
```


Calculate the mean observed weight and pull out the value.

```{r}
weight_mean_obs <- ncbirths %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight)) %>%
  pull()
```


Calculate the two-sided p-value.

```{r}
weight_mean_ht %>%
  filter(stat >= weight_mean_obs) %>%
  summarize(
    one_sided_p_val = n() / n_replicates,
    two_sided_p_val = 2 * one_sided_p_val
  )
```
