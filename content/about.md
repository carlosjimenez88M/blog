Hi! I am Daniel JimÃ©nez, Principal Data Scientist in [Chiper](https://chiper.co/), where I develop advanced analytics,machine learning model and statistical programming for differents company needs.At the same time I am teacher in [Universidad Nacional de colombia](https://unal.edu.co/),
where I teach the following subjects: Big Data, Introduction to Data Science and Statistical Learning and Machine Learning.

I am passionate about Applied Machine Learning, Statistical Modelling, Bayesian Data Analysis and Forecasting models. I more than nine years of experience developing and applying for differents industries,mainly for public institutions and strartups.


### Frameworks

I use the foollowings frameworks

* [Tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) +1 year, principal goal: Modeling and Machine Learning models

* [Keras](https://keras.io/) +3 years, principal goal: Deep learning and visual recognition.

* [Tenserflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) + 3 years, principal goal: Deep Learning 

* [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) + 3 years, principal goal: Data Science.

### Development 

I am fanatic of the following tools

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): Create images for Machine Learning Industrialization.

* [Jenkis](https://www.jenkins.io/): For automatization projects.

* [Github](www.github.com): For create repositories and differents tools.

* [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial?_ga=2.205139024.1787439701.1587844230-88612942.1587844230&_gac=1.27985614.1587944809.CjwKCAjw4pT1BRBUEiwAm5QuR_gWCIcu0tY7VaF4r5QIg3uEMwGk60bx6XNRRiUr1WvrfALNmWuXixoCE7AQAvD_BwE&pli=1), For create workflow and models automatization, but the principal characteristic is Big Query for create the best Data Bases with Big Data.


### Tools
